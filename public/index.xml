      <description>GDP components over time and among countries:
At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports).
The GDP data we will look at is from the United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today.</description>

      <description>IMDB ratings: Differences between directors
I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I will run a hypothesis test and calculate the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors.
Null and alternative hypothesis:
H0: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is equal to zeroH1: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is not equal to zero</description>
