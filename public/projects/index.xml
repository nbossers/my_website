      <description>GDP components over time and among countries:
At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports).
The GDP data we will look at is from the United Nationsâ€™ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today.</description>

      <description>IMDB ratings: Differences between directors
I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I will run a hypothesis test and calculate the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors.
Null and alternative hypothesis:
H0: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is equal to zeroH1: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is not equal to zero</description>
