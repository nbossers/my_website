IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I will run a hypothesis test and calculate the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors. 


Null and alternative hypothesis:

H0: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is equal to zero
H1: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is not equal to zero

Loading data and examining its structure:

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
```

R analysis:

```{r}
#round values up to 3 decimals
options(digits=4)

#Cleaning the data and removing the unnecessary columns 
movies_clean <- movies %>% 
  filter((director=="Steven Spielberg")|(director=="Tim Burton")) %>% 
  subset(select=c("director","rating"))

#Calculating variables required for Confidence Intervals
mean_ratings <- movies_clean %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarise(mean_ratings=mean(rating),
            count_director= count(director),
            stdev_ratings=sd(rating)) 

#Computing standard error and confidence intervals
ci_director <- mean_ratings %>% 
  mutate(se_director=stdev_ratings/sqrt(count_director),
         lower_ci=mean_ratings-1.96*se_director,
         upper_ci=mean_ratings+1.96*se_director,
         
#reorder the directors to appear Spielberg on top in the chart
         director=fct_reorder(director,desc(stdev_ratings)))


#defining colors for error bars
ci_colors <- c("#09bec3", "#f7746b")
  
#Visualizing the data
ggplot()+
  geom_errorbar(ci_director,mapping=aes(x=director, 
                                        ymin=lower_ci, 
                                        ymax=upper_ci),
                                        width=0.05,
                                        size=2,
                                        color=ci_colors)+
  geom_point(ci_director, mapping=aes(x=director,
                                        y=mean_ratings),
                                        size=4,
                                        color=ci_colors)+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_rect()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?",
     subtitle = "95% Confidence intervals overlap",
     x="",
     y="Mean IMDB Rating")+
  geom_rect(aes(NULL,
              NULL,
              xmin=0,
              xmax=2.75),
          ymin=7.290,
          ymax=7.298,
          colour="white",
          size=0.5,
          alpha=0.2)
```
The difference in mean IMDB rating is 0.64.

Examining the graph, we cannot draw any final conclusion, as the overlap in the confidence intervals is minor - this will require some further investigation.

```{r}
#Calculating the difference in means
diff_means <- movies_clean %>% 
  specify(rating~director) %>% 
  calculate("diff in means",
            oder=c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))

#Simulating null distribution
spielberg_burton_null <- movies_clean %>% 
  specify(rating~director) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 5000) %>% 
  calculate("diff in means",
            oder=c("Tim Burton",
                   "Steven Spielberg"))

#Visualising the simulated distribution 
spielberg_burton_null %>% 
  visualize(obs_stat = diff_means) + 
  labs(x = "Difference in mean rating\n(Spielberg - Burton)",
       y = "Count",
       subtitle = "Red line shows observed difference in mean") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

The red line is pretty far in the right tail of the distribution and seems atypical. We can calculate the probability of seeing a difference as big as 0.64 by using the get_pvalue function

```{r}

#Calculating the p value
spielberg_burton_null %>% 
 get_pvalue(obs_stat = diff_means,
            direction = "both")

```

The p value of 0.0104 which indicates that there is a probability of 1.04% to observe a difference in means of the ratings as large as 0.64. 
Therefore, we can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the IMDB ratings of the two directors, with higher ratings for Steven Spielberg than Tim Burton. We can now reject the Null hypothesis.
