H1: The difference in the mean IMDB ratings for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton is not equal to zero.</description>

      <description>GDP components over time and among countries:
At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports).
